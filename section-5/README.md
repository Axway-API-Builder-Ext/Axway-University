# API Builder & the Amplify Platform

API Builder can connect to the Unified Catalog and import APIs for use in flows. You can also use the platform to host your API Builder apps, and store data in a very simple to use database.

1. API Builder & Unified Catalog
We use the CLI to import an API from the Unified Catalog, and put it directly into our project to change the behaviour of the Greetflow. You can find the project here: [music-service](https://github.com/Axway-API-Builder-Ext/Axway-University/tree/main/section-5/music-service)

2. Deploying on Axway Runtime Services
We now deploy the API Builder music-service on Axway Runtime Services and test with Postman.

3. Using the ArrowDB (MBS)
In this video, we create a model and store data in an ArrowDB instance as a custom object. The project is here: [arrow-service](https://github.com/Axway-API-Builder-Ext/Axway-University/tree/main/section-5/arrow-service)
