# Models & Databases

Models are a way for developers to create entities within API Builder to store information. That information could be stored in a database, or just in memory. You can also generate API endpoints from those models, and in this way, you can generate APIs directly from database schemas. In this section, we show you how to create models, how to connect to databases, and how to join data from different data sources in API Builder.

The lessons are:

1. Introducing Models

In this video, we introduce you models, and create an in-memory model and generate an API from it. Check out the [model-project](https://github.com/Axway-API-Builder-Ext/Axway-University/tree/main/section-3/model-project)

2. Generating an API from a database

You can create an API directly from a database by generating a model from the database schema. We demonstrate this here, and it's captured in the [database-project](https://github.com/Axway-API-Builder-Ext/Axway-University/tree/main/section-3/database-project)

3. Joining data in API Builder

Since API Builder can connect to multiple datasources, we can create composite models that join data from two of those sources. In our example, we connect to two  MySQL databases and join data from both in a single API call. The project for this is [database-join-project](https://github.com/Axway-API-Builder-Ext/Axway-University/tree/main/section-3/database-join-project)
